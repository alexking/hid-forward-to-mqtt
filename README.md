# hid-forward-to-mqtt

Forward HID input (such as from a barcode scanner) to MQTT. Use the `config.yaml` file to 
configure things such as MQTT server, topics, and which HID device to read from. 

Check out [hidstream](https://github.com/Amorelandra/hidstream) for additional information 
about connecting to devices, and [MQTT.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js) for queue configuration.
